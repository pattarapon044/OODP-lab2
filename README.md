# Question3

First of all you have to try by your self first.
1. Complete code from file **Deodorant.java** ([guide](src/exercise3/Deodorant.java))

```
path : src/main/java/lab.oodp.oop/Deodorant.java
```
2. Complete code from file **DeodorantApp.java** ([guide](src/exercise3/DeodorantApp.java))

```
path : src/main/java/lab.oodp.oop/DeodorantApp.java
```
3. run file **TestDeodorant.java**

```
path : src/test/java/lab.oodp.oop.test/TestDeodorant.java
```
4. If complete<br><br>
![complete deodorant](src/photo/deodorant.jpg)
<br><br>

5. Goto file **DeodorantApp.java** read at line 14 and think why to use **Double.parseDouble()** method and put the answer in **README.md** file 
<p style="font-size:15;color:red;">!!!Think by yourself</p>

```
Guide : Because data from Keyboard.readInput() method return String
but we have to use double as 'price' parameter in parameter from class Deodorant's constructor, 
so we have to convert it by that method first.
